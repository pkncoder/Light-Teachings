<h1 align="center">Light Teachings</h1>

Light teachings is an application designed to help users understand the basics of Ray Tracing - a computer graphics technique that simulates light to create realistic light interactions inside of a scene.

The app includes an intuitive scene editor and a real time renderer, allowing users to build or modify 3D scenes and instantly see how changes affect lighting, reflections, and transparency. Paired with a series of five short, beginner-friendly videos I made, Light Teachings provides a clear and visual path for learning ray tracing from the ground up.

## Features

- **Scene Editor** – Build or modify your own 3D scenes with simple controls.  
- **Real-Time Renderer** – Watch your lighting and reflection changes instantly update.  
- **Material Customization** – Experiment with colors, transparency, and reflective surfaces of solid objects.
- **Lighting Customization** - Change the color, intensity, and position of the light.

## Educational Videos

Alongside the app, I created a **five-part YouTube series** that explains the core theory behind ray tracing in an easy-to-follow way. These videos complement the app’s interactive lessons.
