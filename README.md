<h1 style="text-align: center">Light Teachings</h1>

Light teachings is an application designed to help users understand the basics of Ray Tracing - a computer graphics technique that simulates light to create realistic light interactions inside of a scene.

The app includes an intuitive scene editor and a real time renderer, allowing users to build or modify 3D scenes and instantly see how changes affect lighting, reflections, and transparency. Paired with a series of five short, beginner-friendly videos I made, Light Teachings provides a clear and visual path for learning ray tracing from the ground up.

## 🎥 Educational Videos

Alongside the app, I created a **five-part YouTube series** that explains the core theory behind ray tracing in an easy-to-follow way. These videos complement the app’s interactive lessons.

## 💭 Inspiration

I created Light Teachings after spending over a year studying ray tracing and struggling to find beginner-friendly resources. Most explanations were too technical or buried in dense research papers. I wanted to create something approachable — a tool that combines visual learning with hands-on interaction.
