## ⭐️ Overview
Light teachings is an application designed to help users understand the basics of Ray Tracing - a computer graphics technique that simulates light to create realistic light interactions inside of a scene.

The app includes an intuitive scene editor and a real time renderer, allowing users to build or modify 3D scenes and instantly see how changes affect lighting, reflections, and transparency. Paired with a series of five short, beginner-friendly videos I made, Light Teachings provides a clear and visual path for learning ray tracing from the ground up.

## ✨ Features
-   **Scene Editor** – Build or modify your own 3D scenes with simple controls.
-   **Real-Time Renderer** – Watch your lighting and reflection changes instantly update.
-   **Material Customization** – Experiment with colors, transparency, and reflective surfaces of solid objects.
-   **Lighting Customization** - Change the color, intensity, and position of the light.

## ❌ Installation
Currently not set up for other people to install, as it was a project for the Congressional App Challenge.

## ⚙️ Usage
Use the scene editor to change elements in the render. Change your point of view to better understand different perspectives, and how light is moving through the scene.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **IDE** - XCode
- **Language** - Swift
- **UI/UX Library** - SwiftUI
- **Rendering Library** - MetalKit
- **Rendering Method** - Ray Tracing

## 📖 Congressional App Challenge
Light Teachings was developed as part of my submission for the [Congressional App Challenge 2025](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/), a nationwide competition encouraging students to learn coding and create impactful apps.

### 📗 Educational Videos
Along with the application, I created 5 Youtube videos, explaining what Ray Tracing is in a simple and understandable way.

Here is the youtube playlist of the videos: [Ray Tracing Theory Explained — YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHfBfCN_zWLxamu8B6hRqdhhFYa-0K01a)
