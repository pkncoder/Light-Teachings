<h1 align="center">Light Teachings</h1>

## Overview
Light teachings is an application designed to help users understand the basics of Ray Tracing - a computer graphics technique that simulates light to create realistic light interactions inside of a scene.

The app includes an intuitive scene editor and a real time renderer, allowing users to build or modify 3D scenes and instantly see how changes affect lighting, reflections, and transparency. Paired with a series of five short, beginner-friendly videos I made, Light Teachings provides a clear and visual path for learning ray tracing from the ground up.
## Features
-   **Scene Editor** – Build or modify your own 3D scenes with simple controls.
-   **Real-Time Renderer** – Watch your lighting and reflection changes instantly update.
-   **Material Customization** – Experiment with colors, transparency, and reflective surfaces of solid objects.
-   **Lighting Customization** - Change the color, intensity, and position of the light.
## Installation
Currently not set up for other people to install, as it was a project for the Congressional App Challenge.
## Usage
Use the scene editor to change elements in the render. Change your point of view to better understand different perspectives, and how light is moving through the scene.
## Congressional App Challenge
Light Teachings was developed as part of my submission for the Congressional App Challenge 2025, a nationwide competition encouraging students to learn coding and create impactful apps.

### Educational Videos
Along with the application, I created 5 Youtube videos, explaining what Ray Tracing is in a simple and understandable way.
