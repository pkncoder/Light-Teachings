## Intro
Hello, my name is Kia Preston, and I made the app Light Teachings.

...light teachings is an application

## What is this
used as an interactive learning app, so people can gain better knowledge on how ray tracing works. Along with this, I made 5 videos teaching the basics of ray tracing.

...you might be asking yourelf "what is ray tracing?"

## What is Ray Tracing?
Ray tracing is a method to create extremly realistic-looking images by simulating how light works in the real world.                                                    
Using math and computer programs, graphics programmers are able to produce high-end video games,                                           
               and the CGI seen in movies.

...I creatated this app, since

## Why this app
Normally the process of learning ray tracing has two main difficulties
1. The learning curve becomes very steep, very fast
2. The tools out there are either not free, or complicated to use or setup for learning Ray Tracing.
To sum everything up, learning even just the theory of ray tracing is something that is reaallly hard, and has taken me a long time to get where I am at

<!-- ## Who is this for -->
Light Teachings is for people who wish to better understand ray tracing, or people who are interested in learning about computer graphics, since ray tracing is becoming more important in the graphics indistry day-by-day.

...with light teachings

## Capabilities of this app
users are able to build, save, and load, scenes with a selection of objects, each with it's own material.
The materials that my custom-built renderer can simulate extends more than just the color or how rough an object is, but can also do metallic objects, mirrors, and transparent objects like glass.
With this, multiple different camera settings and rendering techniques are able to be turned on and off while running the app, giving people insights of how these techniques are used.

...finally,

## A thanks
thank you for considering my app for the Congressional App Challenge!
