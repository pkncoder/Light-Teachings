## Plans
- What is Ray Tracing and where is it used?
    - Explain examples of where people have seen the use of Ray Tracing
        - Video Games
        - Movies
    - Explain the idea of ray tracing
        - Emulating light in the real world with pure math
    - *Overview?*

        - How does ray tracing work on a base level


- How does Ray-Tracing work?
    - How does light work in real life?
        - Light starts from a light source, like a lamp or our sun
        - It bounces around, each time coloring itself based on the color of whatever it hit
        - Eventually it reaches our eyes, and we use the light to see the world
    - How can we emulate this using Ray tracing?
        - We start with creating an "eye" so we can detect light
        - Now, if we start with the same idea as how light works in real lige
            - Light starts from a light source
            - It bounces around a *scene*, coloring itself on each bounce
            - Eventually hitting our "eye"
                - This gives us color information, so we can see the ray traced world around us
    - This works, however is is really show
        - The light that comes from light sources has a very small chance of hitting our eye, so we have to take longer to get more light. Like exposure on a camera
        - Solution
            - To ensure that all of the light hits our eye, we can do things in reverse
            - Instead of starting from light sources, we can make *rays* that start from our eye, going outward into a *scene*
            - For every object that *ray* hits along it's path, we save the color
            - Eventually the ray will hit a light source and we can use the final color of our *ray* to paint a picture
    - Overview
        - Light in real life comes from light sources like a lamp or our sun, bounces around getting colored until it hits somebodies' eye, letting us see the world
        - In ray tracing however, we do things backwards, we send our *rays* from an eye, hitting objects, giving the ray a color, and eventually hitting a light source, letting us paint a picture

    - Wanted final solution
        - A scene
            - One purple ball to the left of center
            - One red ball to the right of center
    - How do we get there
        - As said before, we send rays through every pixel in our imaginary camera
            - We then test to see what it hits before it reaches a light
        - For now, let's igore the "bounce until a light is hit" so it can be simplier
        - On each ray we will do a "ray dash" function
            - Ray dash functions (this is something that I am calling to generalize these functions to make it easier to understand)
                - A mathimatical function that returns values that we can use to see if a ray hit an object
                - Examples
                    - Ray-Sphere
                    - Ray-Box
                    - Ray-Triangle
                - Ray dash functions return the distance that the ray traveled before it hit an object
            - If our "ray dash" function returns a positive number we know it hit something
        - Once we figure out what rays hit objects and what rays didn't hit objects we can color accordingly
            - Remember, each pixel was assined one ray 
            - If a Ray-Sphere function returns a hit, then we color that pixel white
            - If the Ray-Sphere function returns that we didn't hit anything, color that pixel black
                - *send the user to the app to look at scene #1 for this, one white ball in the center of the scene*
        - Currently we only have one sphere in our scene that is only colored white
        - How can we get 2 balls instead of 1?
            - When doing our Ray-Sphere function on each ray, we can do it twice
                - Once for the first sphere, then the second sphere
            - *send the user to the app to look at scene #2, with the two white balls at their positions*
        - Final thing: coloring
            - In the "ray dash" function, it currently returns the distance until the object hits an object
            - Change it to also return which object it hits 
            - For this scenario, let's call the first sphere object 1 and object 2
            - Now, instead of coloring the pixel white if hit
                - If object 1 is hit, return object 1's color (purple)
                - If object 2 is hit, return object 2's color (red)
            - *send the user to look at scene #3, the final one with the wanted balls (1 purple to the left, 1 red to the right)*
