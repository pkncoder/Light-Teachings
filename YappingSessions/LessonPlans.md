        - How does ray tracing work on a base level


- How does Ray-Tracing work?
    - How does light work in real life?
        - Light starts from a light source like a lamp or suns
        - It bounces around, each time tinting itself based on the color of whatever it hit
        - Eventually it reaches our eyes, and is percevied so we can see the world
    - How can we emulate this using Ray tracing?
        - If we use the same idea as in real life...
            - Starting from a light source
            - Bounding around until aimlessly
            - Eventually hitting an imaginary camera
            - Wherever the light hit on the camera correlates to what pixel is colored i
        - It would work, however there's one downside
            - Since most light doesn't hit the tiny area for our imaginary camera it becomes really slow
        - Solution
            - Do everything a little bit backwards
            - Start by sending objects called rays from our imaginary camera until it hits a light
                - For example, one ray for every pixel in the scene
            - For every obect that ray hit along it's path to a light source, it gets colored based on that object's color
            - Finally, the pixel is colored with the found color
    - Overview
        - Light in real life comes from light sources like lamps or the suns, bounces around getting tinted until someone percevies it
        - In ray tracing we send it from an imaginary camera and until it hits a light source, and is tinted based on what it hit throughout it's journey

    - Wanted final solution
        - A scene
            - One purple ball to the left of center
            - One red ball to the right of center
    - How do we get there
        - As said before, we send rays through every pixel in our imaginary camera
            - We then test to see what it hits before it reaches a light
        - For now, let's igore the "bounce until a light is hit" so it can be simplier
        - On each ray we will do a "ray dash" function
            - Ray dash functions (this is something that I am calling to generalize these functions to make it easier to understand)
                - A mathimatical function that returns values that we can use to see if a ray hit an object
                - Examples
                    - Ray-Sphere
                    - Ray-Box
                    - Ray-Triangle
                - Ray dash functions return the distance that the ray traveled before it hit an object
            - If our "ray dash" function returns a positive number we know it hit something
        - Once we figure out what rays hit objects and what rays didn't hit objects we can color accordingly
            - Remember, each pixel was assined one ray 
            - If a Ray-Sphere function returns a hit, then we color that pixel white
            - If the Ray-Sphere function returns that we didn't hit anything, color that pixel black
                - *send the user to the app to look at scene #1 for this, one white ball in the center of the scene*
        - Currently we only have one sphere in our scene that is only colored white
        - How can we get 2 balls instead of 1?
            - When doing our Ray-Sphere function on each ray, we can do it twice
                - Once for the first sphere, then the second sphere
            - *send the user to the app to look at scene #2, with the two white balls at their positions*
        - Final thing: coloring
            - In the "ray dash" function, it currently returns the distance until the object hits an object
            - Change it to also return which object it hits 
            - For this scenario, let's call the first sphere object 1 and object 2
            - Now, instead of coloring the pixel white if hit
                - If object 1 is hit, return object 1's color (purple)
                - If object 2 is hit, return object 2's color (red)
            - *send the user to look at scene #3, the final one with the wanted balls*
